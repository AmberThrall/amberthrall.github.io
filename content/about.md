I am a mathematician and computer scientist interested in topological data analysis. 
I am currently a Ph.D graduate student at Washington State University studying mathematics. 
I received a bachelors of science in mathematics from University of Washington Bothell in 2018.

This website serves as a portfolio showcasing select projects as well as hosting my writing on math and technology.
