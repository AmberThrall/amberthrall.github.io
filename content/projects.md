### Paragon

Paragon is a C++ machine learning application powered by [LIBSVM](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/).
Paragon performs an exhaustive grid-search to determine an optimal set of parameters, then performs backward sequential feature selection to find the most significant features of a given data set.
