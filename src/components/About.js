                <p>
                    I am a mathematician and computer scientist interested in backend development and algebra. I am currently a Ph.D graduate student at the University of Washington studying mathematics.
                    I received a bachelors of science in mathematics from University of Washington in 2018.

                    As a mathematician, I have published two articles relating to eigenvalues:
